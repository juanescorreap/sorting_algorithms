# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Project developed by Juan David Pe√±a and Juan Esteban Correa as part of the foundations program at Holberton School.

It's purpose is to help the student understand:

At least four different sorting algorithms<br />
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm<br />
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input<br />
What is a stable sorting algorithm<br />
